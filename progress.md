## 🔴 Mistake Registry

| Session | Day | Topic | Mistake | Status |
|---------|-----|-------|---------|--------|
| 4 | 4-5 | Load Balancer | Said "least robin" — confused RR and Least Connections names | ❌ Unresolved |
| 4 | 4-5 | Load Balancer | Thought Weighted RR is for different request processing times (it's for different server specs) | ❌ Unresolved |
| 4 | 4-5 | Load Balancer | Couldn't recall LB algorithm names during Simon Drill | ❌ Unresolved |
| 4 | 4-5 | Load Balancer | Forgot DNS-based LB limitations (TTL stale IP, no real-time health check) | ❌ Unresolved |
| 4 | 4-5 | Load Balancer | Thought 8.8.8.8 is ISP DNS (it's Google Public DNS) | ❌ Unresolved |
| 4 | 4-5 | Load Balancer | Confused sticky sessions and Redis external store as same approach (opposite strategies) | ❌ Unresolved |
| 4 | 4-5 | Load Balancer | Missed sticky session risk: uneven load distribution | ❌ Unresolved |
