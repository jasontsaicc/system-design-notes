## 3. Key Decisions & Rationale

### Why Go?

| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| Goroutines | Maps directly to SD concurrency concepts |
| `net/http` | Quick API prototyping for PoC |
| Static typing | Forces clear data modeling (good for interviews) |
| Docker-friendly | Single binary, tiny containers |

### Why This Topic Order?

```
Go Basics → Framework → Building Blocks → Distributed Theory → Applied Problems → Mock
     ↑            ↑            ↑                  ↑                  ↑            ↑
   Tools       Method       Components         Concepts           Synthesis    Practice
```

Each phase builds on the previous:
- **Phase 1** gives you the **vocabulary** (LB, Cache, DB, MQ...)
- **Phase 2** gives you the **theory** (CAP, consistency, replication...)
- **Phase 3** forces you to **combine** them into real systems
- **Phase 4** trains you to **articulate** under time pressure

### Why Tier System for Phase 3?

| Reason | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Prevent burnout** | 13 problems in 25 days was unrealistic |
| **Concept coverage** | Tier 1 alone covers 90% of core concepts |
| **Diminishing returns** | Tier 3 topics overlap with Tier 1 concepts |
| **Focus > breadth** | Deep mastery of 8 > surface knowledge of 13 |

### New Topics Added & Why

| Topic | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|
| **Security & Auth** | Every SD interview asks "how do you authenticate?" — was missing |
| **Unique ID Generator** | Appears as sub-problem in almost every design |
| **Web Crawler** | Google classic; exercises Bloom Filter from Day 26 |
| **Proximity Service** | Covers spatial indexing (Geohash/QuadTree) — unique concept |

### Topics Deprioritized & Why

| Topic | Covered By | Unless... |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Video Streaming | CDN (caching) + async (notification) | Interviewing at Netflix/YouTube |
| Cloud Storage | Consistency + dedup (crawler) | Interviewing at Dropbox/Google |
| Task Scheduler | Notification (queue) + Payment (locking) | Interviewing for infra team |

### DevOps Advantage Strategy

Your DevOps background is a **differentiator** most SD candidates don't have:

| When To Use It | Example Phrase |
|----------------|---------------|
| Component selection | "In production we use ALB for L7 because..." |
| Operational concerns | "I'd set up CloudWatch alarms on P99 latency and 5xx rate" |
| Scale discussion | "From experience, ElastiCache cluster mode handles this well but watch for..." |
| Trade-off analysis | "Multi-AZ adds latency but the availability gain is worth it for payment flows" |

## 4. Interview Language Cheat Sheet

> Every notes file must include these elements:

```
📝 One-liner:     "X is a system that [does what] for [who/why]"
⚖️ Trade-off:     "We chose X over Y because [reason], accepting [downside]"
📈 Scale trigger:  "At [N] QPS/users, we need [component] because [bottleneck]"
🔧 DevOps angle:  "In production, I'd monitor [metric] and alert on [threshold]"
💰 Capacity:       "We expect [N] DAU, [N] QPS, [N] GB/day → biggest cost is [X], cut by [Y]"
🛡️ Security:       "Main abuse vector is [X]; countermeasure is [Y]" (Phase 3 only)
```
